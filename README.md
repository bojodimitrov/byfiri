# byfiri: a file system

the name comes from the words **by**te, because it is in-memory file system with a byte array in its core, **fi**le since it is a file system, and **ri** just because it sounds coolish.

to start it run **go build** and after that **byfiry.exe {size} {size abbreviation}**, ex. **byfiri.exe 1 GB**
